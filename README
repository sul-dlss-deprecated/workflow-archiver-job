This project basically provides the run_archiver script and configuration in order to perform
workflow archiving.

The heavy lifting is done by the workflow-archiver gem, so there is no lib directory.

To Deploy via Crontab and whenever gem
Run the following command (replace XXXXX with the environment you're running in):
% bundle exec whenever -i workflow-archiver-job --update-crontab --set 'environment=XXXXX'
