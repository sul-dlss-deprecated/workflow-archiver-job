# Workflow Archiver Job

This project basically provides the `run_archiver` script and configuration in order to perform
workflow archiving.

The heavy lifting is done by the `workflow-archiver` gem, so there is no lib directory.

There are no tests, except manual integration testing. All tests are in the `workflow-archiver` gem.
